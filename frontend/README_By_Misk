=== This is a simple basic Node.js server Applikaton page
Its using Node.js as server, express as framewok, pug for usage template, also using a bootstrap that can be changes for different layout.
---

QUICK GUIDE: 
# I think if you having everything installed on your computer, you only need to do
# in the frontend directory.
# For this current package.json, nodemon is needed, this can be removed (in the startup scrips setup )or just install it.
$ git clone git@github.com:atgse/trainee-team21.git
$ git checkout master
$ cd trainee-team21/frontend
$ npm install nodemon
$ npm run start
# starting on:   http://localhost:8080/

=== My Personal setup:
(can see isntallation in user_data, except the sudo yum( thats for linux, Then i provisioning to the aws vm linux machine))

(michel skoglund,) using brew as installing packager management)
But could use any of your choose, just as long you get the right source code, or installer

Im using npm v0.35.3, nvm 12.16.1 ( beacuse this was the version ATG using (maybe easier for them to implmentin, if we are using this???)), and nodemon for make the express reqognize any code changes and render them direly in local env.

=== Requierments:
Node.js
npm
nvm
express
pug
=== Optional... BUT REQ WITH CURRENT SETTING !!!!!!
# To remove this change it in the package.json
nodemon

======  Installation for MacOs  ======
===DISCLAIMER===
This works for me on MacOs and Linux, but different steps can be different on your local envorinment.
===DISCLAIMER===

1. Download git repo:

2. install Node.js inc.npm and nvm ( global installer ( the other requriements are installed in your working directory))

3.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
# we restart terminal just to activate
source ~/.bash_profile

4. install nmv version, the one that ATG seems to use, and restart shell
nvm install 12.16.1
source ~/.bash_profile

5. Prepare the workdirectory and initlize and install reg, restart shell for to be sure everythings works
cd nextgen/frontend
npm init -y
npm i -D nodemon
npm i express
npm i pug
source ~/.bash_profile

6. Install modules ( dependecy from the package-lock.json)
# in the nextgen/frontend directory
